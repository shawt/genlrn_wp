The two motor outputs (A and B) can be separately controlled, the speed of each motor is controlled via a PWM input signal with a frequency up to 100kHz. The STBY pin should be pulled high to take the motor out of standby mode.Logic supply voltage (VCC) can be in the range of 2.7-5.5VDC, while the motor supply (VM) is limited to a maximum voltage of 15VDC.

The SparkFun Digital Multimeter, however, is not your average multimeter, it features a loud continuity sound, current/voltage sense, and quality probes. You can use the multimeter to measure DC and AC voltage, DC current, resistance, continuity, and test diodes. With this version we’ve done away with the bright flashy colors that can get us into trouble and gone with a nice, neutral gray. This multimeter should provoke no strong feelings one way or the other, we know this because our guts say “maybe.”</FONT></P><P ALIGN=""LEFT""><FONT FACE=""Times"" SIZE=""12"" COLOR=""#000000"" LETTERSPACING=""0"" KERNING=""0""></FONT></P><P ALIGN=""LEFT""><FONT FACE=""Times"" SIZE=""12"" COLOR=""#000000"" LETTERSPACING=""0"" KERNING=""0"">This isn’t your expensive, flashy type of multimeter, this is for all those starving students that need to buy their first good, low-cost digital multimeter. This meter doesn’t have the ability to auto-power off, it isn’t capable of auto-ranging, and it won’t be able to measure frequency. However, with this multimeter you WILL be able to measure DC Voltage from 200mV to 600V, AC Voltage from 200V and 600v, DC Current between 200uA to 10A, and Resistance from 0 to 20M Ohm. We even left a meter on to test the battery life - it lasted more than 170 hours (7 days) before the included 9V gave out!</FONT></P>[/ectext]","","14.950","0.000","0.000","0.000","0.000","99","0","0","1.000","3.000","2.000","5.000","","stem,steam,maker,robotics,electronics","0","1","17","","multi1_8cde320073b07fc4887f8521a124755d.jpg","multi2_df7aa6c5e462ffeb1deb168420d47d3e.jpg","multi3_0581e87dc0cec5e779adcef6f4b548dd.jpg","","","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","1","1","1","0","0","2015-09-06 20:56:17","1","0","0","201","0000-00-00 00:00:00","1","0","0","","","1","M","0","0","0","0","0","","0","","0","","0","","0","designer","","","","","This inexpensive but indespensible tool for every electronics student can be used to measure voltage, resistance, and amperage.","1","3","0","#333333","#ffffff","","none","0","00000","0.000","5950641","0","0","","Online Sales","Cost of Goods Sold","Inventory Asset","",""

A hall effect sensor is much smaller, but can handle less current than a reed switch.The device includes an on-chip Hall voltage generator for magnetic sensing, a comparator that amplifies the Hall voltage, and a Schmitt trigger to provide switching hysteresis for noise rejection, and open-collector output. An internal bandgap regulator is used to provide temperature compensated supply voltage for internal circuits and allows a wide operating supply range.If a magnetic flux density larger than threshold Bop, DO is turned on (low).
